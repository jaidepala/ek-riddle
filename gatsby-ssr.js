/*
    * Implement Gatsby's SSR (Server Side Rendering) APIs in this file.
    *
    * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/
    *
    * Gatsby server is rendering while building HTML. 
    * You can replace some head elements to be rendered in your index.js. 
    * This is very useful when you need to change the order of scripts or 
    * styles added by other plugins. 
    * Otherwise, Gatsby ssr is very useful when you want to integrate Redux, 
    * css-in-js libraries, etc. and when you need to custom setups for server rendering.

    * Below is the list with available functions you may use in gatsby-ssr.js:

    * onPreRenderHTML
    * onRenderBody
    * replaceRenderer
    * wrapPageElement
    * wrapRootElement
